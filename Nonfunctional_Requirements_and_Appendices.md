5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements

5.1 Performance Requirements
The Portfolio Builder system must deliver consistent performance across all supported platforms and usage scenarios to ensure optimal user experience. Initial application loading shall complete within 3 seconds on broadband connections (minimum 5 Mbps bandwidth), with subsequent page navigation completing within 1 second to maintain user engagement. The portfolio generation process represents a critical performance requirement, completing within 10 seconds for standard portfolios containing up to 10 projects, 5 work experiences, and typical content volumes. This timing ensures users remain engaged during the generation process without perceiving system delays. The system shall support concurrent usage by up to 100 simultaneous users without performance degradation, with API response times remaining under 2 seconds for all operations. Database query performance must maintain sub-500ms response times for user data retrieval and portfolio information access to ensure responsive interface interactions. File upload operations shall process images up to 5MB within 15 seconds, with progress indicators providing user feedback during longer operations. The application must maintain smooth animations at 60 FPS on devices with modern hardware specifications and gracefully degrade on older systems while preserving core functionality. Memory usage shall not exceed 512MB per user session to ensure compatibility with resource-constrained devices.

5.2 Safety Requirements
The Portfolio Builder system implements comprehensive safety measures to protect user data and ensure reliable operation under various failure conditions. Automatic data backup mechanisms shall preserve user portfolio information every 30 seconds during active editing sessions, preventing data loss due to browser crashes, network interruptions, or unexpected system failures. This frequent backup schedule ensures minimal data loss in worst-case scenarios. Input validation and sanitization prevent malicious code injection and protect against data corruption through invalid user input, maintaining system integrity and user data safety. The system includes graceful error handling that maintains application stability during unexpected conditions, providing clear recovery instructions to users when errors occur rather than displaying technical error messages. Session timeout mechanisms (30 minutes of inactivity) protect against unauthorized access on shared devices, while automatic logout prevents data exposure in public computing environments. File upload safety includes comprehensive validation of file types, sizes, and content to prevent malicious file introduction that could compromise system security or user privacy. The system maintains detailed audit logs for critical operations, enabling issue diagnosis and recovery procedures when necessary while complying with data retention policies. Backup and recovery procedures ensure portfolio data can be restored within 24 hours in case of system failure or data corruption.

5.3 Security Requirements
Portfolio Builder implements enterprise-grade security measures protecting user accounts, personal information, and portfolio data from unauthorized access and cyber threats. User authentication requires secure password policies enforcing minimum 8 characters with mixed case letters, numbers, and special characters, combined with bcrypt hashing (cost factor 12) for secure password storage. Multi-factor authentication options enhance account security for users requiring additional protection in sensitive environments. Session management utilizes secure, httpOnly cookies with CSRF tokens preventing cross-site request forgery attacks and session hijacking attempts. The system implements role-based access control ensuring users can only access and modify their own portfolio data, preventing unauthorized data access between user accounts. Data encryption includes AES-256 encryption for sensitive information at rest and TLS 1.3 for all data in transit, ensuring confidentiality throughout the data lifecycle. Input validation and output encoding prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, while parameterized database queries eliminate SQL injection vulnerabilities. The system includes rate limiting (100 requests per minute per IP address) and progressive account lockout mechanisms (5 failed attempts with increasing delays) preventing brute force attacks. Regular security updates and automated dependency monitoring ensure protection against newly discovered vulnerabilities. Privacy compliance includes GDPR readiness with user data export capabilities and consent management for data processing activities.

5.4 Software Quality Attributes
The Portfolio Builder system prioritizes multiple quality attributes ensuring long-term success and user satisfaction across diverse usage scenarios. Usability receives highest priority with intuitive navigation, clear visual hierarchy, and minimal learning curve enabling users to create complete portfolios within 30 minutes of first use. The interface design emphasizes ease of use over ease of learning, providing immediate value to users while supporting advanced features for experienced users. Reliability ensures 99.5% system uptime with automatic error recovery and graceful degradation when individual components fail, maintaining core functionality even during partial system outages. Maintainability follows clean code principles with modular architecture, comprehensive inline documentation, and automated testing coverage exceeding 80% for critical components, enabling efficient future enhancements and bug fixes. Scalability supports horizontal scaling to accommodate growing user bases and feature expansion without requiring architectural redesign, ensuring long-term viability. Portability ensures consistent functionality across all supported browsers and operating systems with responsive design adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and input methods. Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards ensures usability for users with disabilities through comprehensive keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and appropriate color contrast ratios exceeding 4.5:1. Performance optimization prioritizes fast loading times and smooth interactions over advanced visual effects when resource constraints exist, ensuring broad device compatibility.

5.5 Other Requirements
Additional system requirements encompass various technical and operational considerations essential for successful deployment and long-term operation. Database requirements include MongoDB deployment with replica set configuration for high availability and automated backup procedures with 30-day retention periods ensuring data durability and disaster recovery capabilities. Internationalization support enables future localization efforts with Unicode UTF-8 encoding throughout the system and externalized text strings facilitating multi-language capability expansion. Legal compliance requirements include GDPR readiness with comprehensive user data export capabilities, integrated privacy policy presentation, and granular consent management for all data processing activities. Browser compatibility extends to Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, and Edge 90+ with graceful degradation strategies for older browser versions, ensuring broad user accessibility. The system requires SSL certificate implementation for production deployment and supports deployment on major cloud platforms including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure with containerization support for scalable deployment. Monitoring and analytics integration enables comprehensive usage tracking, performance monitoring, and automated error reporting for continuous improvement and proactive issue resolution. The application includes extensive logging capabilities for debugging and audit purposes while maintaining strict user privacy protections and data anonymization where appropriate.
