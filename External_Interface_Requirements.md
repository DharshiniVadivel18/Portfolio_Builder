4. External Interface Requirements

4.1 User Interfaces
The Portfolio Builder provides a modern web-based user interface designed for intuitive portfolio creation and management. The interface follows Material Design principles with consistent navigation patterns, responsive layouts, and accessibility compliance. The main interface components include a header navigation bar with authentication controls, a dashboard for portfolio overview, and a six-step creation wizard with visual progress indicators. Standard interface elements appear consistently across all screens including a logout button in the top-right corner, breadcrumb navigation for wizard steps, and contextual help tooltips. The color scheme utilizes professional gradients (#667eea to #764ba2) with glassmorphism effects for visual appeal. Error messages display as contextual notifications with clear, actionable text, while success confirmations use subtle animations. The interface supports keyboard navigation with tab order and screen reader compatibility for accessibility. Form validation provides real-time feedback with color-coded indicators and descriptive error messages. The responsive design ensures optimal display across desktop (minimum 1920x1080), tablet (768px width), and mobile (375px width) viewports with touch-friendly controls on mobile devices.

4.2 Hardware Interfaces
Portfolio Builder operates as a web application requiring standard computing hardware without specialized interfaces. The system supports input through conventional peripherals including keyboards for text entry, pointing devices (mouse, trackpad) for navigation, and touchscreen interfaces on mobile devices. Camera access is utilized on mobile devices for profile picture capture through the browser's media API. File system integration enables document upload functionality supporting common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF) with maximum file size of 5MB. The application leverages browser-based hardware acceleration for smooth animations and transitions, utilizing GPU rendering when available. Network connectivity requirements include standard TCP/IP interfaces for internet access with automatic adaptation to varying connection speeds. The system requires minimum 1GB RAM for optimal performance and supports devices with modern processors capable of running contemporary web browsers. No specialized hardware drivers or external devices are required for system operation.

4.3 Software Interfaces
The Portfolio Builder integrates with multiple software components across the technology stack. Frontend interfaces include React.js (version 18.2.0+) providing component-based architecture, React Router (version 6.15.0+) for client-side navigation, and Axios (version 1.5.0+) for HTTP communication. Backend interfaces utilize Node.js (version 18.0.0+) runtime environment, Express.js (version 4.18.2+) web framework, and middleware components for CORS, authentication, and request processing. Database integration employs MongoDB (version 6.0+) with Mongoose ODM (version 7.5.0+) for data modeling and query operations. Browser APIs include File API for document handling, Local Storage API for session persistence, and Canvas API for potential image processing. The system interfaces with bcrypt library for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for authentication tokens, and multer for file upload handling. Data exchange follows JSON format with RESTful API endpoints for user management (/api/auth/*), portfolio operations (/api/portfolios/*), and file operations. External service interfaces may include SMTP services for email notifications and cloud storage APIs for future file hosting capabilities.

4.4 Communications Interfaces
Portfolio Builder implements secure communication protocols ensuring data integrity and privacy. The primary communication utilizes HTTPS protocol with TLS 1.3 encryption for all client-server interactions, preventing unauthorized data interception. RESTful API architecture governs communication patterns with standardized endpoints and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). WebSocket connections may be implemented for real-time features such as live preview updates and collaborative editing. The system supports standard HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500) for comprehensive response handling. Data formatting follows JSON standards with UTF-8 encoding supporting international characters. Message formatting includes structured error responses with error codes and descriptive messages for client-side handling. Communication security implements CSRF protection through token validation, input sanitization to prevent injection attacks, and rate limiting (100 requests per minute per IP) to prevent abuse. The system includes graceful degradation for network connectivity issues with offline capability through browser caching mechanisms. Synchronization mechanisms ensure data consistency during concurrent user sessions with optimistic locking for portfolio editing operations.
